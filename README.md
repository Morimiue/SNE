## Postscript from Bowei Zhang

Dear admissions committee,

This project is a lab project that I have collaborated with another group member to implement. 
To further prove that I can independently implement sequential computer programmes, please follow [this link](https://github.com/archer-76/Disease-auxiliary-diagnosis-system-based-on-gut-microbes-and-machine-learning-methods) to access my graduation project, which was designed, implemented, and tested by myself. Thank you for your attention and patience.
